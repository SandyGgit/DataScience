# Data Science --- Practical Hands-on Data Scientist Projects (Machinge Learning and Neural Network/DL):

# MACHINE LEARNING Projects:

# Linear Regression:
Fuel Consumption and car emission. 

# Cycling project around my neighborhood
Multiple Linear Regression - Build a linear regression model in Python using the scikit-learn package. Predict the calories spent during cycling around the neighborhood

Logistic Regression - Perform Logistic Regression and predict cycling goal reached

# Logistic Regression:
Predict the survival rates of the Titanic based on the passenger features.

Predict customer behavior towards targeted marketing ads on FB.

# Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Predict cancer diagnosis benign or malignant based on several observations/features.

Predict Bank clients eligibility to retire given their features such as age and 401K savings

# K-Nearest Neighbour
Iris plant Classification

T-Shirt size Classification

# Decision Trees and Random Forest
Kyphosis Disease Classification

Perform sentiment analysis and analyze custoomer reviews for Amazon Alexa products

# Naive Bayes: 
Spam Classifier 

Credit Card Fraud Detection

# NEURAL NETWORK and DEEP LEARNING Projects:

# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
Build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. 

# Build Deep Neural Network

Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model. Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer). Implement an easy-to-use neural network class
