# Data Science --- Practical Hands-on Data Scientist Projects:

# Linear Regression:
Fuel Consumption and car emission. 

# Logistic Regression:
Predict the survival rates of the Titanic based on the passenger features.

Predict customer behavior towards targeted marketing ads on FB.

# Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Predict cancer diagnosis benign or malignant based on several observations/features.

# Naive Bayes: 
Spam Classifier 

Credit Card Fraud Detection

# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
Build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. 

# Build Deep Neural Network

Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model. Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer). Implement an easy-to-use neural network class
